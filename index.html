     <h2 class="h2">Work experience</h2>
    <ul class="work">
      <li><span class="colortext"><b>Facebook</b></span></li>
      <p class="p">Joining forces with friends, Zuckerberg creates a social network, initially called "The Facebook," 
        which allows users to create profiles, upload photos, and communicate with each other. 
        After completing his sophomore year, Mark quit his studies to devote himself entirely to the site 
        and moved the company to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had already reached 1 million users.</p>
      <li><span class="colortext"><b>Microsoft</b></span></li>
      <p class="p">For his graduation thesis, he created a program to recognize the musical tastes of Internet
         users - Synapse, which Microsoft later wanted to buy for $2 million. 
         The management of the giant IT company offered to hire him as an employee until he graduated, 
         but he refused both remuneration and cooperation, saying that "inspiration is not for sale."
